# Metal-Operator Documentation

**Welcome to the Metal-Operator Documentation!**

The `metal-operator` is a Kubernetes-native operator, part of the IronCore open-source project, designed for robust bare metal infrastructure management. By leveraging Baseboard Management Controllers (BMCs) and the Redfish API, `metal-operator` enables streamlined and automated server discovery, provisioning, and lifecycle management. Using the Kubernetes Controller pattern, `metal-operator` provides a CRD-based operational model that standardizes bare metal management across different hardware environments. Integration with vendor-specific tooling is also possible for enhanced functionality when needed.

## Key Features

### 1. **Discover and Onboard Bare Metal Servers**
- Automatically detect and register bare metal servers through BMCs and the Redfish API.
- Efficiently gather hardware specs, network configurations, and initial health checks directly from BMC interfaces.

### 2. **Provision Software on Bare Metal Servers**
- Deploy and configure software on registered servers using BMC interactions and standardized provisioning workflows.
- Support for dynamic software configuration and Redfish API-based management for consistent, vendor-neutral provisioning.

### 3. **Manage Server Reservations**
- Reserve specific bare metal resources based on workload needs.
- Prevent resource conflicts by managing reservations via Kubernetes-native CRDs, ensuring that workloads align with available hardware resources.

### 4. **Perform Day 2 Operations**
- Utilize the Redfish API to manage BIOS, firmware, and driver updates.
- Automate ongoing maintenance tasks and operational workflows to maintain infrastructure resilience and uptime.

### 5. **Decommission and Maintain Faulty Servers**
- Decommission servers via BMC controls for clean removal from active pools.
- Schedule and perform maintenance tasks with BMC data to optimize uptime and maintain hardware reliability.

## How It Works

The `metal-operator` relies on **BMCs and the Redfish API** to handle bare metal server management tasks. Through a CRD-based operational model, `metal-operator` provides Kubernetes-native management of bare metal infrastructure, enabling consistent, vendor-neutral interactions.

### Core Components
- **Custom Resources (CRs)**: Extend Kubernetes to manage server configurations, reservations, and operational workflows.
- **Controllers**: Automate lifecycle management through Redfish-enabled interactions, from provisioning to decommissioning.
- **Reconcilers**: Ensure the desired state matches the actual state by continuously monitoring hardware via BMC integrations.

### Architecture Overview

1. **Discovery**: Register new bare metal servers through BMCs and Redfish API, creating CRDs for streamlined management.
2. **Provisioning**: Apply software images and configurations using Redfish API, based on templates or custom configurations.
3. **Operations**: Execute BIOS, firmware updates, and other maintenance tasks through standardized workflows.
4. **Decommissioning**: Safely remove or maintain servers using Redfish and BMC controls, marking them for reuse or retirement as needed.
